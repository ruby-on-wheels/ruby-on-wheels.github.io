After visiting family in Berlin and along the Baltic Sea, I noticed strange noises from the front axle while driving. At first, a quick visual check didn’t show anything unusual. It wasn’t until I lifted the front wheels that I noticed a lot of play. Uh-oh! I had planned a trip to northern Spain soon, so I wanted a quick solution.

By chance, I was near Alfeld, home to the [Mercedes-Benz Classic Workshop](https://www.classic-truck.de), which specialized in old Mercedes vehicles. 

![Mercedes-Benz Classic workshop in Alfeld](/assets/images/IMG_7565.jpg)

Normally, I like fixing things myself, but this time I decided to let the professionals handle it to get back on the road faster.

![Truck in the workshop](/assets/images/IMG_7580.jpg)

Once the brake drum hub was removed, the cause of the noises became clear. The bearing play had been incorrectly adjusted, which caused the bearing cups inside the hub to rotate. Unfortunately, this had worn away some material, and the bearing cups no longer fit properly.

![Grooves in the brake drum’s bearing seat](/assets/images/20230705_151901.jpg)

Crap! I needed new brake drum hubs, but neither the workshop nor I could find any replacements. The situation seemed tricky. I couldn’t leave the truck there much longer. The mechanics suggested a practical solution: have the hubs machined and fit a custom metal sleeve.

I wasn’t completely sure if it would hold up on the road, but I trusted the professionals, I had no real alternative. After a day, the hubs were reinforced and ready to be installed.

![Ring pressed into the brake drum’s bearing seat](/assets/images/20230713_113859.jpg)

Yay! After just three days, I was back on the road and the noises were gone. I headed toward southern Germany for a short stop at my friends’ farm in Bavaria before continuing to northern Spain.

But after 500 km, new whistling noises appeared at the front axle. At least the truck could stay safely at the farm, but the trip to northern Spain would have to wait.

![Truck parked in the field next to my friends' farm](/assets/images/IMG_7614_2.jpg)

## Taking things apart on my own

Disappointed by the workshop’s repair attempt, I realized I’d have to tackle the problem myself. I first got copies of the service manuals from the 60s and 70s for my truck. Still a bit hesitant, I slowly started inspecting the damage.

![Removing the right front wheel to inspect the damage](/assets/images/IMG_7668.jpg)

After taking off the freewheel hub, I hit my first obstacle: the outer locknut. According to the service manual, it was tightened to 150 Nm and required a special spindle nut socket which, of course, was impossible to get on short notice.

![Locknut for the outer wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7670.jpg)

## Building a custom spindle nut socket

After several failed attempts to get hold of the original spindle nut socket, I decided to make my own using an 88.9 × 3.2 mm steel tube, adding six claws, each 10 mm high and 10 mm wide.

![Building the spindle nut socket for the wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7650.jpg)

Additional holes allowed me to slide a steel bar through the tube for better leverage.

![Custom spindle nut socket for the front wheel bearing of a Mercedes LA 1113](/assets/images/IMG_7669.jpg)

Supported by a jack, I was then able to loosen the tight locknut using a long lever.

![Using the selfmade spindle nut socket to open the wheel bearing.](/assets/images/IMG_8010.jpg)

## Inspecting the damage

Finally, I could remove the brake drum hub. Even before cleaning, it was clear that the pressed-in ring had slipped out of the hub and was covered in burn marks.

![Ring popped out of the bearing seat](/assets/images/IMG_7675.jpg)

The ring had slipped several millimeters out of the hub (red arrow) until it touched the spindle sleeve, causing noticeable wear (yellow arrow).

![Damaged ring that slipped out of the bearing seat](/assets/images/IMG_7696.jpg)

Ugh! Now not only were the brake drum hubs ruined, but the spindle sleeves were also damaged. Very frustrating! And all after a “professional” repair that had cost me several hundred euros.

![Material wear and burn marks on the spindle sleeve](/assets/images/IMG_7682.jpg)

Now I had to resume my previously unsuccessful search for replacement brake drum hubs, and on top of that, find matching spindle sleeves.

## Finding the spare parts

I felt both motivated and a bit overwhelmed. I had tried every option I knew, but there was no turning back: the axle was half disassembled in a field, and the truck wouldn’t move until I solved it myself.

For weeks, I scoured classifieds, contacted workshops, hobby mechanics, and scrap yards. Slowly, I started enjoying the challenge. Even without the right parts, I met interesting people who offered help or contacts. I even considered getting a whole used Mercedes 1113 as a donor truck. Until, nearly a month later, I finally found what I was looking for: an old front axle from a Mercedes LA 1113.

![Used front axle of a Mercedes LA 1113](/assets/images/IMG_7845.jpg)

## Taking the spare wheel end apart

Now it was time to tear the axle down to get the parts I needed. First, I locked the brake drum in place by turning the adjuster eccentrics for the brake shoes outward. First on the rear shoe,

![Locking the rear brake shoe](/assets/images/IMG_7929.jpg)

then on the front one.

![Locking the front brake shoe](/assets/images/IMG_7930.jpg)

Then I removed the collar nut on the axle shaft flange.

![Loosening the large center nut to remove the drive flange](/assets/images/IMG_7931.jpg)

Eight flange nuts followed,

![Removing the eight nuts that press the drive flange onto the brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_7933.jpg)

allowing the drive flange to be carefully pulled off the axle shaft with the help of a wrench, applying even pressure all around.

![Carefully pulling off the drive flange using a wrench](/assets/images/IMG_7935.jpg)

The locking plate on the outer spindle nut was bent open with a screwdriver.

![Bending back the lock plate for the outer spindle using a screwdriver](/assets/images/IMG_7936.jpg)

The outer spindle nut was loosened using the homemade spindle nut socket,

![Opening the outer spindle using the custom spindle nut socket](/assets/images/IMG_7937.jpg)

and then removed.

![Removing the outer spindle](/assets/images/IMG_7938.jpg)

Then the locking plate came off,

![Removing the lock plate](/assets/images/IMG_7939.jpg)

and afterward, the inner spindle nut.

![Removing the inner spindle](/assets/images/IMG_7940.jpg)

With that done, the brake shoes were released again,

![Loosening the brake shoes again](/assets/images/IMG_7941.jpg)

so the drum hub could be pulled off.

![Pulling off the brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_7942.jpg)

To drive out the inner wheel bearing cup, I modified a flat steel punch, slightly beveling and dulling the tip to avoid causing damage.

![Small, lightly tapered steel rod used to push the inner wheel bearing out of the brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_7951.jpg)

With gentle, targeted blows applied evenly around the edge, I slowly and carefully drove the bearing out.

![Gently tap out the inner wheel bearing from the brake drum, applying light, even blows from all sides.](/assets/images/IMG_7953.jpg)

Now the snap ring of the outer wheel bearing could be removed using blacksmith’s tongs, allowing the outer bearing and the spacer to be taken out.

![Using blacksmith’s tongs to loosen and remove the snap-ring, allowing the outer wheel bearing to be removed.](/assets/images/IMG_7958_2.jpg)

All parts were thoroughly cleaned.

![Cleaned bearings, outer bearing races, spacers, and so on](/assets/images/IMG_7965_2.jpg)

The only part left was the spindle sleeve. The locking plates were bent open to remove the four lower,

![Releasing the locking plate for the bottom bolts holding the brake backing plate](/assets/images/IMG_7862.jpg)

and two upper screws,

![Top bolts holding the brake backing plate](/assets/images/IMG_7863.jpg)

allowing the brake backing plate to be taken off.

![Removed brake backing plate](/assets/images/IMG_7866.jpg)

The spindle sleeve was now accessible,

![Spindle sleeve on the axle](/assets/images/IMG_7867.jpg)

 and ready to be removed and cleaned.

![Disassembled spindle sleeve](/assets/images/IMG_7868.jpg)

## Replacing the spindle sleeves

Now that the replacement parts were secured, the damaged spindle sleeves on the truck had to be removed following the same procedure.

![Mercedes LA 1113 jacked up without front wheels in the field](/assets/images/IMG_8005.jpg)

Since the brake fluid had been replaced recently, I kept the brake system closed to avoid having to bleed it again, leaving the brake hoses in place.

The brake backing plate with the brake shoes was very heavy and couldn’t be allowed to fall, as that could damage the brake hoses. To prevent any accidents while removing the six screws, I secured it with a ratchet strap and a simple support setup.

![Brake backing plate secured with a ratchet strap](/assets/images/IMG_8021.jpg)

After the screws were removed, the brake backing plate was carefully set aside and securely placed on the axle.

![Disassembled brake backing plate lying on the axle](/assets/images/IMG_8022.jpg)

Now the damaged spindle sleeve could be removed,

![Front axle without brake and spindle sleeve](/assets/images/IMG_8023.jpg)

the “new” one installed,

![Mounting the spare spindle sleeve](/assets/images/IMG_8025.jpg)

and finally reassembled along with the brake backing plate.

![Mounted spindle sleeve and brake backing plate](/assets/images/IMG_8026.jpg)

## Preparing the "new" brake drums

Once the truck was ready, I turned to refurbishing the “new” brake drums.

![Used and dirty brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_7878.jpg)

I cleaned off the accumulated dirt, lightly sanded the braking surface to remove surface rust,

![Cleanded brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_7883.jpg)

and gave all spacers, bearing races, bearings, and snap rings a thorough cleaning.

![Cleaned wheel bearings, bearing races, spacer rings, snap ring, and shaft seal](/assets/images/IMG_7881.jpg)

First, the outer spacer ring was set into place.

![Outer spacer ring into the brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_7902.jpg)

Next, the outer bearing’s roller cage was properly greased and installed.

![Greased outer wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7903.jpg)

Then the outer bearing race, pre-chilled in the freezer to shrink it for easier installation, was fitted into place.

![Bearing race for the outer wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7904.jpg)

I made custom tools from hard plywood plates,

![Auxiliary tools made from a hard plywood plate for tapping the bearing races into the brake drum hub](/assets/images/IMG_7901.jpg)

to drive the bearing race into place.

![Tapping the bearing race onto the outer wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7905.jpg)

Once driven in, the bearing and its race were properly seated in place.

![Outer wheel bearing in place](/assets/images/IMG_7909.jpg)

The assembly was secured by snapping the outer bearing’s circlip into its groove using blacksmith’s tongs.

![Snap ring securing the outer wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7910.jpg)

Next, the spacer ring for the inner bearing was installed.

![Spacer ring for the inner wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7911.jpg)

Next, the outer race of the inner bearing, also pre-chilled, was laid in position.

![Inner wheel bearing race](/assets/images/IMG_7912.jpg)

Using my homemade tool and a hammer, I carefully drove the bearing race into the drum hub,

![Tapping the inner wheel bearing race into the brake drum hub](/assets/images/IMG_7914.jpg)

until it was fully seated.

![Inner wheel bearing race in place](/assets/images/IMG_7915.jpg)

Now the greased inner bearing could be placed in position.

![Greased inner wheel bearing](/assets/images/IMG_7916.jpg)

The final component was the shaft seal, with its outer metal shell lightly coated in sealant.

![Shaft seal with sealing compound on the outer metal race](/assets/images/IMG_7921.jpg)

Again, I used the homemade tool and very gentle taps with a hammer to drive the seal flush into place.

![Tapping in the shaft seal](/assets/images/IMG_7922.jpg)

The drum hub was now ready for assembly.

![Brake drum hub with installed wheel bearings, ready for installation](/assets/images/IMG_7925.jpg)

## Mounting everything back together

After placing the drum hub, the bearing play needed to be set to 0.02–0.04 mm. I used a dial gauge to help with this.

![Setting the wheel bearing clearance (0,02 - 0,04 mm) with a dial indicator](/assets/images/IMG_8013.jpg)

Since tightening the outer nut slightly reduces the bearing play, it took me a few attempts at first until I got the hang of it. But in the end, everything was correctly assembled.

![Wheel mounted on the brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_8019.jpg)

I got so caught up in the flow that I forgot to take photos of the individual steps. To my unease, I started doubting whether I had correctly installed the six screws for the spindle sleeve and the brake backing plate, since they were two different lengths. I was fairly confident I had done it right, but not 100%.

To be sure, I decided to disassemble everything again. By now, I was experienced, and it was also a perfect opportunity to take detailed photos to provide a helpful step-by-step guide for others.

## Getting hold on a proper spindle nut socket

After several uses, the teeth on my homemade spindle sleeve nut tool were worn, and it kept slipping under heavy load. Just in time before the next disassembly, I finally got hold of the original tool, part number 731 589 000 700.

![Original Mercedes spindle nut socket, part number 731589000700](/assets/images/IMG_7659.jpg)

Unlike my homemade version, it fit perfectly down to the millimeter and included a central guide that made the work much easier.

## Taking the wheel end apart again

Equipped with proper tools and my previous experience, I began the third disassembly, this time taking photos of every step:

Removing the wheel using a wheel bolt centering and protective sleeve set.

Taking off the brake drum hub.

![Taking off the brake drum hub](/assets/images/IMG_8340.jpg)

It turned out the six screws had been installed correctly, so my worries were unfounded. At least the third disassembly went much faster, and I was able to take photos to create a guide that could help others.

## Putting the wheel end together

Reassembly was relatively straightforward, following all the steps in reverse order:

First, placing the brake drum onto the hub.

![Mounted brake drum](/assets/images/IMG_8350.jpg)

Installing the inner locknut.

![Installing the inner locknut](/assets/images/IMG_8351.jpg)

Tightening the locknut to seat the bearings properly in the brake drum hub.

![Tightening the locknut to allow the bearings to settle into the brake drum hub](/assets/images/IMG_8352.jpg)

Setting the wheel bearing clearance (0,02 - 0,04 mm) with a dial indicator. I recommend starting with a slightly larger clearance, since tightening the outer locknut will reduce it slightly. It took me a few tries to get the feel for it, but it’s far better to adjust and check multiple times than risk damaging a bearing or the drum. After all, this whole project began because of incorrectly set bearing play.

Wow! After many weeks of research, sourcing parts, and hands-on work, the truck was finally fully operational again.

![Truck ready for operation again after wheel hub assembly overhaul](/assets/images/IMG_8318.jpg)

What an exciting project! I was proud of myself and incredibly grateful to everyone who helped make it a success. I learned a lot, not just about mechanics, but also that seemingly impossible problems can be solved by taking small, determined steps, being patient, and asking others for help.
