I [built]({% post_url 2020-01-04-building-storage-furnitures %}#storage_compartment) a couple of small storage compartments spread across my van that I used to store my clothes. The cabin of the truck offered much more space than I had in the van, so I decided to built a spacious wardrobe to store all clothes in a central place.

I started with a simple sketch to get an idea of how to arrange the storage compartments.

I wanted a very light, yet stable wardrobe, so I built a scaffold using wooden dowels instead of working with thick wooden panels.

The scaffold was very light.

When adhering the 4mm birch plywood panels, the whole construction became very stable.

The basic construction of the wardrobe weighed less than 10kg.

I used the same technic to build the door of the wardrobe: Instead of mounting a heavy thick wooden panel, I build a light frame,

and embedded a thin 4mm birch plywood panel that provided stability.

Once the basic construction was ready, I installed it into the cabin in front of the bed on the right side.

The light door nicely fitted into the wardrobe.

Inside the door, I installed a mirror and a few removable boxes to store socks and underwear.

To avoid the wardrobe getting too hot, I built a heat shield out of aluminium to reflect the heat of the chimney.

I really liked the result of this project. I was finally able to store my clothes in a spacious wardrobe. :tada:
