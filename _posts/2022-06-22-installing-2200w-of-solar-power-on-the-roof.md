The [roof was renovated]({% post_url 2022-06-17-renovating-the-roof %}) and equipped with custom mounting points for the solar panels. It was about time to install the panels that I had ordered during the winter when the prices and delivery times were still appropriate.

The [500W solar system of my van]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}#solar-system) provided sufficient power from spring to autumn to operate all my electric devices. But when staying in Germany during the winter, I had to give up on some comfort: On an average winter day, the system made only about 300Wh a day, so there was only enough power to run my laptop, the WiFi router and the LED lights. I couldn't use the boiler, induction cooker or the fridge.

The roof of the truck offered much more space, so I was able to optimize my setup for the winter: the more panels the better. Luckily, I found a manufacturer offering 200W solar panels that nicely matched with the dimensions of the roof: Five on the front roof and six on the back roof, so 2200W in total. This was more than four times of the capacity that I had installed on my Mercedes 508D. 2200W would provide much more flexibility when spending time in the north during the winter. 

## Installing the panels

Installing the panels on the roof was straight forward. The semi-flexible solar panels nicely aligned with the [curved mounting points on the roof]({% post_url 2022-06-17-renovating-the-roof %}#mounting-points).

It didn't take much time to mount the five panels on the front roof.

The six panels on the back were also mounted quickly.

Once all the panels were installed, I wired everything up. All panels on the front roof were connected in series. So were the panels in the back. Connecting all panels in series would have resulted in a very high voltage. I already had a solar charger that didn't support the high voltage, so I decided to run two solar chargers in parallel. One for the front roof and one for the back roof. I routed the cables through one of the portholes that were nicely protected from the weather by the overhanging roof.

Nice! I was finally able to autonomously supply my truck with electricity.
