I [moved from the Mercedes 209D into the 508D]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) more than a year ago. While working on the 508D, I stored all my food, tools and clothes in boxes. I wanted to get rid of the chaos in my van and built several storage furnitures in 2019. The base kitchen cabinet was one of the first furnitures that I built in the summer:

The cabinet consists of a big drawer containing the fridge,

a drawer for the cutlery,

and a few shelves to store my pots, pans and other dishes.

<span id="storage_compartment">As</span> the [shelf that I integrated into the wall of the shower cabin]({% post_url 2019-04-16-building-the-kitchen %}) didn't provide enough space for my tea equipment, I extended the shelf above the kitchen countertop. There was still plenty of space above the shelf, so I built an additional storage compartment with two LED lights for better illumination in the kitchen:

Right below the [foldable table for the electric cooker]({% post_url 2019-04-16-building-the-kitchen %}), I built a cabinet to store my underwear and all kind of other things.

I also attached a little shelf holding the electric kettle.

Unfortunately, I observed people using the shelf as a handle to pull them into the van. The construction is not designed to hold a human being, so I might cover the shelf with a curtain to prevent people from breaking it. :thinking:

As a final step, I built a foldable panel covering the huge storage area above the driver's cabin. The living area looks much more tidy now:

I've (mostly) turned my initial vision of the van into reality and feel very comfortable in my tiny home on wheels. I'm so glad that I [started this project 18 months ago]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %})!
