After more than a year of hard work fixing up my truck, I was finally ready to hit the road. My destination? The beautiful region of Catalonia in Spain.

The trip began smoothly, but as I traveled through France, I ran into unexpected troubles: my truckâ€™s serpentine belt broke.

Luckily, only one of the two belts failed, but the other was also worn out. I needed to replace them.

I stopped at an Isuzu truck garage that I found right next to the highway. The staff was quite helpful. They supported me ordering the matching serpentine belts and allowed me to camp out in front of their garage while I waited for the parts to arrive.

I spent three days there, using the time to make some minor improvements to my truck, like adding a bar for mounting the shower curtain.

Once the new belts arrived, I replaced them and continued my journey towards Catalonia with renewed enthusiasm.

Finally, I was back on the road!

My first stop in Spain was Vic.

The weather was chilly, the trees were bare, and there was little left to make me stay.

So, I decided to head closer to the coast to enjoy the milder climate and spend time with friends in Barcelona and the surrounding areas.

I found a lovely viewpoint just outside Barcelona.

It was a peaceful spot with a fantastic view of the city.

From there, I could easily bike into town to hang out with friends at various bars and restaurants. I spent a few days working and relaxing at this scenic location.

After a few days enjoying the peaceful viewpoint, I moved into Barcelona. One of my teammates came to visit, which made the stay even more enjoyable.

We worked together in my mobile office and took a short trip along the coast to Sitges,

where we basked in the sunny weather, enjoyed cold beers, and savored delicious tapas.

I was happy to enjoy visiting places and reconnecting with friends again.
