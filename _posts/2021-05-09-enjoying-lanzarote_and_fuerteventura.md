Our [Canary-camper-crew]({% post_url 2021-03-16-starting-the-new-year-on-the-canary-islands %}#camper-crew) slowly started to break up. Some of us met other friends on other islands or had to set out on their journey back to the European mainland. Toward the end of March the core of our group had left Fuerteventura and I spent a couple of days on my own in the south east of the island near [el Tabloncillo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Tabloncillo/).

## Returning to Lanzarote

I felt like a change and decided to take a ferry back to Lanzarote where I spent the first days near [Playa del Papagayo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+del+Papagayo), one of my most favorite beaches on Lanzarote.

A few days later, someone I had previously met on Fuerteventura came to Lanzarote, too. We both worked from my van and spent our free time hiking around the island. On a cloudy weekend, we climbed around the crater of [volcano La Corona](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monte+Corona/),

where we found a lot of flowers growing out of the cracks.

The weather was much better when we stayed near [Famara](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Famara) where we enjoyed the view on the cliffs during the sunset.

We also spent a couple of days in and around [Haría](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35520+Har%C3%ADa,+Las+Palmas,+Spain), a very relaxed village in the mountains.

We enjoyed lovely sunsets just a few kilometers west of Haría with amazing views on Famara and [la Graciosa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Graciosa).

I had visited seven of the Canary Islands, so I was looking forward to finally visit the smallest of the eight main islands. Visitors weren't allowed to bring their cars or campers on the little island, so we decided to take the ferry early in the morning to surround and explore the islands by bike on a single day. We took a long beach break at [Playa de las Conchas](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+las+Conchas/), one of the most beautiful beaches that I had seen on the Canaries.

After our trip to la Graciosa, we spent a couple of days in the North of Lanzarote in front of [Playa De Orzola](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+De+Orzola+Lanzarote).

A few kilometers south-east of Orzola, we stayed close to [Mala](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35543+Mala,+Las+Palmas,+Spain) in a field full of volcano rocks.

There was a natural pool right next to the van where we could enjoy the sun and refreshing baths.

On our way to the southern part of the island we stayed in another rocky field near [Mancha Blanca](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35560+Mancha+Blanca,+Las+Palmas,+Spain) where we had a nice view on volcano [Caldera Blanca](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caldera+Blanca/).

We spent our last days on Lanzarote in the South where we visted the "[green lake](https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Lago+Verde/)".

We really had a great time on Lanzarote and were both positively surprised how well it worked to stay together in a six square meters "apartment" for more than four weeks.

## Spending the last days on Fuerteventura

After my visitor flew back to the mainland from Fuerteventura, I spent a couple of days working and surfing at the north-west coast of Fuerteventura.

I stayed in good company with other Mercedes enthusiasts: A couple from Italy living in long 407D

and Martin and Peggy from Germany living in a beautiful and gigantic Mercedes 1113.

Time flew. In May, I realized that I had almost spent half a year on the Canary Islands. The winter was over, so I decided to book a ferry to [Cádiz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/C%C3%A1diz,+Spain/) in Spain. I felt ready and motivated to go back to the mainland to welcome spring.

I met and stayed with so many great people. What a lovely winter! :sunny:
