Before my [stay in Catalonia]({% post_url 2023-03-16-enjoying-the-catalan-winter %}), I had built three [drawers]({% post_url 2023-01-07-building-drawers-for-the-kitchen %}) for the [kitchen unit]({% post_url 2022-12-02-building-the-kitchenette %}), providing storage for the essentials. Nearly a year later, it was time to bring the original vision of the kitchen unit to life and construct the remaining cabinet doors and drawers.

As usual, I began by cutting all the individual parts with my circular saw.

Once the individual parts were made, I glued them together piece by piece

until all three basic drawers were ready for the finishing touches.

After that, I began working on the front panels, carefully chiseling out the cutouts for the pull locks.

The frames of the front panels were bonded with strong dowel joints.

To make the Vienna straw matting easier to work with, I soaked it in warm water before installation.

After a few minutes in the water, the Vienna straw matting could be perfectly clamped in the frames of the front panels.

After a final sanding and oiling, the drawers were ready for installation.

With the pull locks installed, three extra drawers were now available beneath the refrigerator.

The deep and wide drawers provided ample storage space.

After the drawers, I moved on to the frames for the cabinet doors, which I also joined with dowels,

fitted with Vienna straw matting and finished with oil.

The new doors and drawers looked noticeably different from the older ones, which had slightly yellowed from last year’s sunlight. It wouldn’t be long before the new pieces aged and blended in color too.

To create a neater, more cohesive look, I made matching pastel-colored curtains: one to hide the water tank under the table,

one for the boiler beneath the fridge, and one to conceal the electrical setup under the double floor by the shower.”

I was very satisfied with the result. The kitchen felt even warmer and more welcoming than before.
