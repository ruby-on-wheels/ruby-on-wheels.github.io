When working out of my van in warm areas, I either had to close the doors to keep flies and mosquitos out of the van or accept a bunch of insects invading my office while enjoying a fresh breeze. The cabin of the truck had [a lot of windows]({% post_url 2022-02-14-installing-an-additional-window %}) and I wanted to be able to keep them open without having to worry about insects, so I mounted pull-out mosquito nets into the sidewalls.

With the help of a spring, the nets were automatically rolled up and could be easily pulled down to keep insects out of the cabin.

I cut five of these roll-up nets to size and installed them in front of each window.

I also fitted a bunch of wooden slats that would allow me to mount the window sills later on.

I was finally done with preparing the cabin for applying the wall-cladding. :tada:
