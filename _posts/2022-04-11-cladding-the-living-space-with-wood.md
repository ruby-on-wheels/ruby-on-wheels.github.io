After [building the skeleton of the bathroom]({% post_url 2022-03-01-building-the-skeleton-of-the-bathroom %}), I continued preparing the panels for the wall cladding.

The temperatures were still quite low, so I took advantage of a sunny day to oil the panels.

Similarly, as [in the bedroom]({% post_url 2022-01-19-cladding-the-bedroom-with-wood %}), I build a bunch of wooden stripes to hold the panels together.

The strips nicely covered the gaps between the panels and made sure they were properly aligned to each other.

## Mounting the panels

When the oil was finally dry, I put all the panels into the cabin. I only used screws to mount the panels on the doors.

All the other panels were just loosely attached to each other without using any screws as the furniture that I was planning to build would press the panels to the wall later on. So there was no need for any unnecessary screws going through the vapor barrier.

## Installing a proper latch for the back door

The previous latch for locking the backdoor wasn't very practical: it only closed the doors on the top which resulted in a little gap on the bottom. It also required a padlock to make sure the lock stayed closed while driving. While cladding the doors in the back, I took the chance to install a proper latch that was able to close the doors on the top and the bottom with a handy lever in the middle.

There were no more gaps when the latch was closed. Much better!

## Cladding the ceiling

Once all the walls were covered with wooden panels, I continued with the ceiling of the living area. To ensure a symmetric look of the cladding, I started with a board in the center of the ceiling.

Once the board was properly installed I worked my way from the center to the sides.

When reaching the sidewalls I had to cut the boards to size to make sure they nicely aligned.

I carefully measured and cut each board to avoid large visible gaps in the corners.

Once all the boards were installed, I provisionally wired up the LED spotlights to checkout the result:

I was quite happy with the outcome. The cabin looked much more cozy. I felt like making progress!
