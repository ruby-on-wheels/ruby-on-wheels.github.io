After successfully [completing the bathroom]({% post_url 2023-01-04-completing-the-bathroom %}), I turned my attention back to the kitchen, where I aimed to create drawers that were not only appealing but also well-ventilated and lightweight. During my search for materials, I came across Vienna straw matting, which seemed like the perfect choice for the drawer fronts due to its blend of style and durability.

Every project begins with a plan. I started by sketching out the design for the kitchen drawers to ensure everything would fit well.

It was freezing cold outside, which made working in an unheated workshop challenging.

To prevent the glue from freezing, I had to assemble the wooden pieces of the drawers inside the cabin of my truck. Thanks to the wood stove and the cabinâ€™s good insulation, it provided perfect conditions for gluing the pieces together.

With the boxes glued, I prepared the drawer fronts,

and chiseled out the necessary cutouts for the locks.

I then attached Vienna straw matting to the front covers of the drawers.

This material was ideal for adding a touch of elegance to the front panels and ensuring proper ventilation, while the rest of the drawer was made from birch plywood and spruce wood, providing both strength and lightness.

With everything ready, I installed the drawers.

Finally, the drawers were finished by installing pull-locks to ensure they don't open while driving.

The new kitchen drawers, featuring Vienna straw matting on the front covers turned out both functional and stylish. I was quite happy with the outcome of the project and really liked the design.
