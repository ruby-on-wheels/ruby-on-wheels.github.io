When my friend got a few days off work, we thought it was the perfect chance for a little getaway. We wanted to hike, chill, and just be in nature, so we jumped in the truck and headed to the Pyrenees.

Our first stop was at a mountain north of Berga, where we spent a quiet night surrounded by nature.

The next day, we drove a bit further north to Bagà and went for a lovely forest hike.

Along the trail, we spotted the first spring flowers of the year.

Step by step, we kept heading north, deeper into the Pyrenees. The N-260 took us through Martinet, where we made another stop.

During our evening walk, a cat joined us for several kilometers, it seemed to enjoy our company.

We spent a peaceful night on a hillside above the village and woke up to a beautiful sunrise lighting up the mountains.

The following day, we went on more hikes to explore the area and passed through the small village of Montellà. In the distance, we could already see higher peaks covered in snow.

We kept following the N-260 west and found a quiet, beautiful spot to stay near Guils del Cantó.

High up in the mountains, with almost no light pollution, we watched a sky full of stars after sunset, it was magical.

Our trip led us deeper into the mountains. In Espot, we stayed for a few days and went on several day hikes. When we reached Estany de Sant Maurici, it was so cold that the lake was completely frozen and covered in snow.

A bit lower down, the air was warmer, and we saw small creatures like a ladybug crawling through the undergrowth.

Another hike took us to snow-covered peaks and the dried-up Estanys de Trescuro.

Luckily, a mountain stream next to our spot was full of clear water, so with the help of an electric pump we had all the fresh water we needed.

After a wonderful week of hiking and exploring, we drove back to the Costa Brava.

It felt unreal, after walking through snowy mountain landscapes, just a few hours later we were lying in the warm sun by the Mediterranean Sea.

Catalonia’s variety never stops amazing me!
