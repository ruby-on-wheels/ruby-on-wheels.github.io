My [previous camper van]({% post_url 2017-01-11-my-future-mobile-office %}) was equipped with a gas stove and a [450Wp solar system]({% post_url 2017-03-06-ordering-my-solar-system %}) which served me well. Even during the winter, I never ran out of battery. I wanted to avoid installing a gas system into the ambulance and aimed for a solution only based on solar energy. Before building the interior and integrating all the devices into the van, I wanted to make sure everything worked as expected.

## A little trip through Germany

After [fixing]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) the basics of the ambulance, I took a little break from working on the van and went on a little trip though Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The route was about 2000km starting along the [Lake of Constance](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Meersburg/),

the [Rhine Falls](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rheinfall/),

through the [Black forest](https://www.google.com/maps/place/79868+Feldberg+(Schwarzwald)),

around [lakes](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Silbersee)

and through [old towns](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Braubach) in the Rhine valley.

While relaxing and enjoying these beautiful places, I could also test my new equipment in environments like this lonely dirt road:

## <span id="fridge">Ice cold beer :beer:</span>

The absorption refrigerator in my 209D was absolutely inefficient. It was constantly consuming 110W and even didn't do a good job cooling down my food and drinks. I was tired of drinking warm beer during the summer and turning off the fridge at night to save battery.

I wanted a proper solution and bought a [12V compressor fridge](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00D0GLD4S?tag=mumothhoofba-21) from Dometic. While my previous absorber fridge would need 2640Wh a day, the [Dometic CFX 50]((https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00D0GLD4S?tag=mumothhoofba-21)) would only consume about 150 to 300Wh and even allow me to freeze my food. It's a pricy fridge but totally worth it. I have no regrets. No more warm beer, no more battery draining. This fridge is amazing!

## <span id="electric-cooker">Cooking with solar energy</span>

All the energy saved by using a compressor fridge allowed me to use an electric cooker. I installed the [same devices]({% post_url 2017-03-06-ordering-my-solar-system %}) that proved successful in my previous camper van. However, I upgraded the setup with a [2000W voltage converter](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07573DBYF?tag=mumothhoofba-21).

The converter was powerful enough to operate an [induction cooker](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B017IV85KA?tag=mumothhoofba-21) that would boil one liter of water in about a minute. Preparing meals in a [stainless steel pan](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0758H2BF6?tag=mumothhoofba-21) like these crepes worked like a charm.

I was even able to "bake" some delicious self-made pizza. :pizza:

While running these cooking experiments, I measured up to 175A going through the wires. The original wiring didn't convince me. I could feel the cables getting warm after a few minutes. <span id="wiring">Extending</span> the original cables with some additional [50mm2 wires](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01MYRC1GY?tag=mumothhoofba-21) helped to keep the cables cold.

The cooker consumed about 20 to 30Ah for each meal. Depending on the weather and the time it took my two [250Wp solar panels](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01GJLZOK4?tag=mumothhoofba-21) about one to three hours to feed that energy back into the [battery](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00NT9IDDA?tag=mumothhoofba-21).


I had a really nice trip and I was quite happy with the outcome of my experiments. The setup seems very promising and I can't wait to install everything into the van! :tada:
