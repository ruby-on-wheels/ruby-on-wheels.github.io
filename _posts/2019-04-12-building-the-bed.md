I had a two-section bed in my mind: A permanent part in the back of the van right above the [pull-out bike rack]({% post_url 2019-03-07-building-a-pull-out-bike-rack %}) and a convertible part in the middle that could be transformed into a seating area with a table.

## Building the permanent bed

I seamlessly attached the permanent bed to the [seating area]({% post_url 2019-03-04-building-a-scaffold-for-the-seating-area %}).

The bed is about 188cm long and 76cm wide which offers enough space for a single person of my size to sleep comfortably.

## Iterating on the convertible seating area

The seating area offers a lot of storage space that is supposed be accessible from the top. I built a removable cover

and cut matching grooves into the frame of the seating area.

After repeating the same work for the other side, the U-shaped frame of the seating and sleeping area was ready.

As I didn't like the gap between the floor and the socket for the table base,

I spend some extra time on crafting an appealing socket out of oak wood.

I liked the new socket much better.

I used the same oak wood to built the tabletop which turned out very nice after properly sanding and oiling it.

The table can be vertically adjusted and allows me to easily turn the seating area into a huge bed that offers enough space for three persons to sleep comfortably.

I've already ordered custom cushions matching the frame and can't wait to sit, work and sleep in my new seating and sleeping area. :clap:
