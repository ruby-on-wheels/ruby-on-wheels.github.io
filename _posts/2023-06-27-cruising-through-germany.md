Driving north in early summer always feels great. The closer I got to the Alps, the greener the fields became and the fresher the water looked. The trip to Germany went by quickly, just a few short stops in France and visits with friends and coworkers in Switzerland, and soon I reached the green, hilly Allgäu.

I spent a few relaxed days there with family and friends before heading east to the farm where I had spent the previous year restoring and building the truck.

It felt good to be back, enjoy the quiet,

and spend calm evenings by the campfire with friends.

After a few days, I continued north to visit friends in and around Kassel. The kids of a coworker had a great time exploring the truck, both inside and outside.

After some time in the city, I drove out into the countryside to see old friends who had settled in a small community. The place was incredibly relaxed, some people lived in the house, others in trucks or wagons spread around a huge garden where my truck also fit perfectly.

Besides the beautiful old vehicles, it was mainly the kind people who made the place so special.

I also loved their idea of turning a truck and several wagons into one big mobile home for a family of four.

After some wonderful days in central Germany, I continued to Berlin to visit more family and friends. At my favorite spot, I parked next to familiar vehicles, including this old Mercedes-Benz L from the 1950s.

I spent several weeks with my Berlin loved ones. We went to concerts,

enjoyed sunsets at Tempelhofer Feld,

and shared after-work beers on warm summer evenings.

Experiencing Berlin in summer, full of energy and life, is always something special.
