An era had come to an end: [After]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) over 4 years of [incredibly]({% post_url 2020-09-10-approaching-the-arctic-circle %}) [amazing]({% post_url 2021-03-16-starting-the-new-year-on-the-canary-islands %}) [experiences]({% post_url 2021-06-18-enjoying-the-swiss-mountains %}) with my [self-converted Mercedes 508D]({% post_url 2020-11-26-presenting-my-mercedes-508d %}), I decided to say goodbye to my dream camper van. Upon [buying the Mercedes 1113 truck]({% post_url 2021-10-10-buying-an-old-mercedes-1113-truck %}), I understood that eventually parting ways with one of my vehicles was inevitable. Owning two vintage vehicles simultaneously felt out of place for a nomad like myself.

Maintaining the good condition of these old, beautiful, and reliable vehicles would require regular maintenance and care. While the truck's conversion had reached an [advanced stage]({% post_url 2022-09-16-building-the-seating-area %}), I spent hardly any time in the 508D. Yet, I had to [take care]({% post_url 2022-11-04-replacing-thermostat-of-a-dometic-cfx-50-refrigerator %}) of the vehicle repeatedly, which distracted me from working on the truck and gradually became more of a burden.

Realizing that ownership carried responsibility, possessing fewer things appeared more liberating to me. I was ready to part with my beloved Mercedes 508D. Given the perfect condition and high-quality conversion of the van, I had no doubts about finding a buyer willing to pay a fair price.

After packing a few boxes,

the van was emptied and ready for sale.

Oh, what a snug home on wheels it had been!

When entering the van for the last time, a flood of memories washed over me – this cozy home on wheels had witnessed countless beautiful moments.

Everything unfolded rapidly. In just a matter of days, the van was sold. I witnessed my van in motion for the first time, but this time from an external perspective - without me at the steering wheel. What an incredible journey!

Nevertheless, all of this felt right. As the van disappeared on the horizon, I felt a sense of relief, filling me with energy and motivation to persist in my ongoing endeavor — the conversion of the Mercedes 1113 truck into house on wheels, a project aimed at surpassing the legacy of the 508D once again.
