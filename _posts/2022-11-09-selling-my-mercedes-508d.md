An era came to an end: After [more than 4 years]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) of incredibly amazing experiences with my [self-converted Mercedes 508D]({% post_url 2020-11-26-presenting-my-mercedes-508d %}), I decided to part ways with my dream camper van. I faced a practical dilemma from the moment I [acquired the Mercedes 1113 truck]({% post_url 2021-10-10-buying-an-old-mercedes-1113-truck %}) – managing two vintage vehicles simultaneously was not sustainable for a nomad.

Maintaining the good condition of these old, beautiful, and reliable vehicles would require regular maintenance and care. While the truck's conversion had reached an [advanced stage]({% post_url 2022-09-16-building-the-seating-area %}), I spent hardly any time in the 508D. Yet, I had to [take care]({% post_url 2022-11-04-replacing-thermostat-of-a-dometic-cfx-50-refrigerator %}) of the vehicle repeatedly, which distracted me from working on the truck and gradually became more of a burden.

Recognizing that ownership came with responsibilities, I embraced the philosophy that owning less is indeed more liberating. I was ready to part with my beloved Mercedes 508D. Given the perfect condition and high-quality conversion of the van, I had no doubts about finding a buyer willing to pay a fair price.

After packing a few boxes,

the van was emptied and ready for sale.

Oh, what a snug home on wheels it had been!

When entering the van for the last time, a flood of memories washed over me – a testament to the cozy home on wheels that had been witness to countless beautiful moments.

It didn't take long, and the van was sold. Then everything happened very quickly, and after a few days, I saw my van driving for the first time. From the outside. Without me behind the wheel. Who knows, maybe for the last time.

Nevertheless, all of this felt right. I felt a sense of relief as the van disappeared on the horizon and was full of energy and motivation to continue my ongoing endeavor – the transformation of the Mercedes 1113 truck, a project fueled by the aspiration to surpass the legacy of the 508D once more.
