More than a year had passed since I [bought the truck]({% post_url  2021-10-10-buying-an-old-mercedes-1113-truck %}) in October 2021. During that time, I had [repaired]({% post_url 2022-06-12-repairing-the-cabin %}), [fixed]({% post_url 2022-06-17-renovating-the-roof %}), [renovated]({% post_url 2022-06-21-laminating-and-painting-the-cabin %}), and built a multitude of things. Although there were still numerous tasks left to complete the vision I had in mind, the truck seemed ready for its first trip, satisfying the basic needs: a [wood-based heating system]({% post_url 2022-08-08-installing-a-hydronic-heating-system %}), [solar-powered electricity]({% post_url 2022-06-22-installing-2200w-of-solar-power-on-the-roof %}) for my work laptop and other devices, a functional [kitchen]({% post_url 2022-12-02-building-the-kitchenette %}), a [shower with a toilet]({% post_url 2023-01-04-completing-the-bathroom %}), a [bed]({% post_url 2022-01-19-cladding-the-bedroom-with-wood %}), a [wardrobe]({% post_url 2022-02-11-building-the-wardrobe %}), and a [seating area]({% post_url 2022-09-16-building-the-seating-area %}) for eating, working, and relaxing.

After installing a pullable trash bin,

and picking up some useful gadgets for the kitchen from IKEA,

I filled the [drawers]({% post_url 2023-01-07-building-drawers-for-the-kitchen %}) with food and cleaned everything thoroughly.

Despite not having all items finished, the truck already offered a very comfortable and cozy atmosphere. The large, comfortable bed provided a perfect spot to relax for at least two people.

The burning wood stove kept the cabin warm and inviting during cold moments.

Relaxing in the gigantic seating area, the spacious living space was evident, making it feel like a true home on wheels.

I had spent every single free minute before and after my full-time job, including all weekends, working on the truck over the past year. By the time winter set in Germany, I was exhausted and felt a strong need for a break. A trip to the warmer south seemed like the perfect way to relax and recharge. All the remaining tasks could wait. The truck and I were ready for the first trip.
