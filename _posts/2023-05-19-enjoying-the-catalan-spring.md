Winter was over, and little by little, spring started to show with warmer days and more sunshine. I loved spending time with my friends in Barcelona, sitting on bar terraces, chatting, enjoying tapas, soaking up the sun, and sipping a cold beer.

As much as I enjoyed the city and my quiet parking spot in Barcelona, I often felt the pull to get out into nature, where I could park freely and enjoy more space.

Every now and then, I went on short trips to explore new tracks and hidden spots.

I kept finding beautiful, peaceful places to work, relax, and sleep, like this little hill near Tossa de Mar.

I also visited some lovely beaches, like Platja de Canyelles,

where it was great to enjoy an evening drink at a beach bar right by the sea.

Or take the first refreshing swims of spring at Playa de Fenals.

While most of my friends around Barcelona lived in regular apartments, my small adventures often brought me together with other travelers. Once, I met an older man from Belgium who asked for help with his Mercedes 407.

He was traveling with a friend who drove an incredible long Mercedes LP 1113 with his dog.

12 meters, a real one-of-a-kind truck!

The sea and the warm, mild weather were wonderful, but I still felt drawn to the Pyrenees now and then. Some friends of mine had a small apartment in Prullans, where I could park my home in a quiet, beautiful spot.

During the day, I worked with great views around me, and in the evenings, we met up for dinner together.

On weekends, we went hiking and visited places like Estany de l’Orri.

Prullans was a bit farther from Barcelona, but I also spent time in the mountains closer to the city — for example, near Mura. It was quiet and peaceful there.

After work, I went on short hikes, explored mountain bike trails,

or walked through the small village for a coffee.

Another favorite area of mine was Montseny. Whenever I needed a break from the city, I went there to relax in the forests,

enjoy the calm, and take in the beauty of nature.

Hiking up peaks like Les Agudes always rewarded me with stunning views.

Big city vibes, sunny beaches, and fresh mountain air, Catalonia had given me a bit of everything. After spending almost half a year in the area, it felt right to head back north to spend the summer with loved ones in Germany.
