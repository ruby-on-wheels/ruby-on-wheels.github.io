:wave: Iâ€™m Jakob, a German software engineer. I live in an old Mercedes truck and [work remotely]({% post_url 2017-10-21-working-productively-in-a-van %}) for [GitHub](https://github.com/). On this website, I write about my experiences building, maintaining, living and working out of vehicles.

At GitHub we use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), a web application framework written in the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language. As I work on Ruby software projects out of vehicles with wheels, I thought it'd be funny to replace *Rails* with *Wheels* for the title of this blog.

In early 2017, I [bought]({% post_url 2017-02-04-the-first-ride %}) an old [Mercedes-Benz 209D camper]({% post_url 2017-01-11-my-future-mobile-office %}), [ordered a solar system]({% post_url 2017-03-06-ordering-my-solar-system %}), [turned the camper into a mobile office]({% post_url 2017-05-06-turning-my-van-into-a-mobile-office %}) and [learned how to fix it]({% post_url 2017-05-18-a-crash-course-on-mechanics %}).

After traveling with the Mercedes 209D for more than a year through Europe and [Northern Africa]({%post_url 2018-01-15-my-first-days-in-africa %}), I sold it in June 2018 to [rebuild an old military ambulance van]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) that I turned into a [perfect mobile home and office]({% post_url 2020-11-26-presenting-my-mercedes-508d %}).

I spent more than four amazing years [maintaining]({% post_url 2021-07-15-maintaining-my-van-in-germany %}), [traveling]({% post_url 2021-03-16-starting-the-new-year-on-the-canary-islands %}) and [living]({% post_url 2020-09-04-answering-22-questions-about-van-life %}) in my 508D, until I [decided]({% post_url 2021-10-10-buying-an-old-mercedes-1113-truck %}) to start [another building project]({% post_url 2021-12-03-starting-the-new-project %}): a mobile house on top of an old Mercedes 1113 truck.

Since I gave up on my apartment in Berlin and [hit the road]({% post_url 2017-05-11-leaving-berlin %}) on May 11th, 2017, I have come across many places in several countries and met a bunch of amazing people:
